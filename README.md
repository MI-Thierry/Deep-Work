# ![icon](https://github.com/MI-Thierry/Deep-Work/blob/main/DeepWork/Assets/Square44x44Logo.altform-lightunplated_targetsize-24.png) Deep Work: A Productivity App

Deep Work is a productivity software inspired by Cal Newport's Deep Work philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of focused, uninterrupted work sessions for achieving peak productivity and better results. By minimizing distractions and devoting sustained periods of time to cognitively demanding tasks, you can enter a state of deep work where your cognitive abilities are maximized. This allows you to produce higher-quality work in less time and develop valuable skills that are difficult to replicate.

## Features:

- **Pomodoro Technique Integration:** Utilize the Pomodoro Technique to stay focused on tasks and set achievable daily goals.
- **Task History Tracking:** Maintain a record of your completed tasks for reference and progress analysis.
- **Visual Work Insights:** Gain valuable insights into your work patterns with clear charts that show how much time you've invested in specific tasks.
- **Flexible Task Management:** Create both long-term tasks and subtasks to organize your workload effectively. Utilize the playground area for easy task addition.
## Supported Platforms:

- Windows 10 (version 17763.0 and later)
## Requirements:

- **.NET 8 SDK (or compatible version):** Download and install the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) or an earlier version that may require some configuration changes to run Deep Work.
- **Windows App SDK (required):** This is required because the project uses WinUI 3 to build the user interface (UI). WinUI 3 is a framework specifically designed for creating modern Windows applications, and it relies on the Windows App SDK for functionality.
